A note from DM: _Starting 2025.06, I hope we can make an action log with bits and pieces of our progress.  Throughout 2024 and 2025 our key people have shared photos and snippets of progress directly in messaging apps and there is so much progress happening behind the scenes I'd love to share with the open source community.  I'll ask our Nigerian team to designate one person in the lab to post updates here as they happen - no need for fancy formatting or professional messages, just real-life info and visuals for other engineers to see and potentially help us further our mission!_

Today (6/13) I got notified that our designers have finalized their drawings, sent them to the manufacturer, and the manufacturer successfully made this custom component from steel.  It looks great!  Paint comes next for the barrel and it will be on its way from Asia to Nigeria in a couple of days!
