# Expansion from FUTO forward

_Here let's share info about our hopes to establish a second lab, based in FUT-Minna.  Some action is happening in parallel:  we are planning on how to replicate the FUTO lab and coordinate between the Nigerian teams directly.  And we are examining the opportunity at Minna to ask "what is needed to step from the current situation to have an operable second lab?"_

## FUTMINNA & National Integration

As a Mechatronics Engineer and SCUTTLE Robotics advocate, I’m proud to lead the northern expansion of SCUTTLE through the Federal University of Technology, Minna (FUTMINNA)—a vital institution in North-Central Nigeria. Our mission is to establish FUTMINNA as a national hub for SCUTTLE Robotics, equipping students, faculty, and researchers with modular, 3D-printable robot systems that encourage hands-on engineering and collaborative innovation. To achieve this, I’m working with department heads to create SCUTTLE-ready labs, while using a structured Google Sheet to assess staff readiness, lab availability, and teaching capacity. A custom Google Form is also collecting institutional data on student interest, resources, and hands-on project history to tailor the rollout across faculties.

In addition to infrastructure and planning, I’m developing an AI-powered chatbot assistant to support students with downloadable 3D part designs, assembly and coding guidance, links to trusted robotic suppliers, and access to Discord and social media communities. This chatbot also guides learners through curated project-based resources, helping them move from beginner to advanced robotics challenges. These tools aim to democratize robotics education and empower students to build, create, and solve real-world problems using open-source technology.

Our model draws inspiration from SCUTTLE’s success at FUTO (Federal University of Technology, Owerri), where Dr. Gaius Nzebuka has pioneered Africa’s first SCUTTLE lab, complete with solar power and secured teaching spaces. We’re now linking FUTMINNA with FUTO for shared curriculum and support, while extending our reach to institutions across the Northern and Central regions—including public universities, polytechnics, and innovation hubs. I also aim to collaborate with nearby private institutions such as Nile University in Abuja, leveraging its proximity and resources to broaden access. This nationwide integration isn’t just about robotics—it’s about creating a generation of empowered, resourceful African engineers. Let’s build the future—one SCUTTLE at a time.
