This page to display our long term goals in the SCUTTLE Nigeria project. 

The lab at FUTO beginning in 2024 is a key milestone to greater aspirations to enhance learning & STEM opportunities in Nigeria & Africa.

Since the whole project is open source, any individual may take initiative to use the designs & content to create new outcomes in their place of study & work.  So, our goals within the SCUTTLE Organization must be focused on supporting rather than controlling that which is made from the seed projects.
