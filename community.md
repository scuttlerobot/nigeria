## Discord

April 2025 - jump into the Discord by David Malawey to [connect with the leaders and community](https://discord.gg/m8RVE4wjkm)) builiding this lab in realtime.  This link takes you to the **Nigeria** channel where it's all happening.

MORE CONTENT COMING SOON! 

_This page is for posting our social networking links.  Students should be able to find each other & find where to reach out to the teams that are actively engaged in the project. Perhaps it will consist of Discord, Key lab contacts, or other relevant forums._

## Fundraising

Fundraising Leader: (April 2025) - we have a new team leader for fundraising to get the final tools to make the lab complete!  She's a mechanical engineering student (graduating soon, in fall 2025) based in Canada.  Reach out to her with the discord handle @nogis directly in the "Nigeria" channel [here](https://discord.gg/m8RVE4wjkm)

Want to support?  There are a dozen ways you can help, from sharing our posts and links to directly helping our engineers at FUTO with their projects!  We are happy to have more people involved. 


## Nigeria

_Key contacts directly inside of Nigeria_

* Dr. Gaius Nzebuka is our primary contact in Owerri, at FUTO.  He is the key leader for the first SCUTTLE lab in Africa, which can be a model for future labs.  Nzebuka's lab began in 2024 with physical space and equipment that formed after planning since 2022. He has direct experience with our Texas learning environments, from his year of research at Texas A&M university.  Dr. Nzebuka has a mechanical engineering background and over a decade of experience as a professor. 
* Dr. Olalekan Olayinka is our primary contact at Covenant University, also near to Lagos, Nigeria and a key consultant for our planning in African robotics efforts.  Dr. Olalekan is equipped to set up stakeholders in the academic space (that includes Students, Professors, lecturers, and university management) to embrace the learning opportunities in the field of robotics that will be provided by SCUTTLE.
* Several faculty members at FUTO are colleagues of Dr. Nzebuka who will likely get involved at the new lab there, and I hope to credit them as the year progresses and we can know more details.

> 2025 Spring: The lab is being assembled!  FUTO faculty have allocated a space for teaching robotics, and our Nigerian team members are installing solar panels, power storage, furniture & security features for the new lab space.  Robot kits have arrived onsite after a very long shipping period and Dr. Nzebuka & his colleagues plan to teach with the equipment this fall semester.

## North America

* Philip McGee is our spearhead for planning the Africa-based activities for the SCUTTLE org since around 2023.
* David Malawey is dedicating technical efforts, and documenting content to share (such as this web page) to keep the door open for collaborators.
* Viam is an exciting business partner who has created several software solutions & easy-to-follow tutorials and we are keeping their team up to speed to engage with the Nigeria group whenever appropriate.  A couple of their staff including Sara Gharnit and Nick Hehr have already performed live webinars for our Malaysia based workshops (THANK YOU SO MUCH!) and we hope to connect them again to kick off viam-on-scuttle software lessons soon.

## Asia
* Dr. Norazmi, as always, has been a guiding participant in the Africa plans as his education/business/government experience is a fantastic resource to choose how to make similar progress in Nigeria as we have in Malaysia.
