April 2025 - jump into the Discord by David Malawey to [connect with the leaders and community](https://discord.gg/m8RVE4wjkm)) builiding this lab in realtime.  This link takes you to the **Nigeria** channel where it's all happening.

MORE CONTENT COMING SOON! 

_This page is for posting our social networking links.  Students should be able to find each other & find where to reach out to the teams that are actively engaged in the project. Perhaps it will consist of Discord, Key lab contacts, or other relevant forums._

## Fundraising

April 2025 - we have a new team leader for fundraising to get the final tools to make the lab complete!  She's a mechanical engineering student (graduating soon, in fall 2025) based in Canada.  Reach out to her with the discord handle @nogis directly in the "Nigeria" channel [here](https://discord.gg/m8RVE4wjkm)

Want to support?  There are a dozen ways you can help, from sharing our posts and links to directly helping our engineers at FUTO with their projects!  We are happy to have more people involved.
